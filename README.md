# Academic Portfolio

## Overview
This portfolio highlights a selection of projects I completed during my time at the *University of St. Thomas*. I chose these projects because they represent work I am proud of and that reflects my growth in computer science, data science, and software development.

Each project focuses on a different area, including artificial intelligence, databases, and web development. Together, they show both my technical skills and my interest in using technology to work with real data, support users, and address real-world problems.

## 🤖 AI Final Project: Machine Learning & Game AI Applications
🔗 **Repository:** [*https://github.com/ranglall/SustaiabilityAIGames*](https://github.com/ranglall/SustaiabilityAIGames)

I included this project because it was a major final project that brought together many of the AI concepts we learned throughout the course, while also drawing on both my computer science and data science background. It was a group project with three main parts: predicting air quality using machine learning, building a sustainability-themed Hangman game with multiple AI guessing strategies to compare their performance, and creating a Wordle-style game using minimax and alpha-beta pruning.

This project stands out to me because it combines technical problem-solving with environmental and sustainability-focused themes, which aligns well with the University of St. Thomas mission of using knowledge to serve the common good. Working with real environmental data and sustainability-related content helped me see how AI and data-driven methods can be applied to meaningful, real-world problems rather than just abstract or toy examples.

## 🏞️ Microbialites Database System
🔗 **Repository:** [*https://github.com/ranglall/Microbialites*](https://github.com/ranglall/Microbialites)

I chose to include this project because it involved working on a real system for a real department at St. Thomas. In collaboration with the Geology Department, we replaced an existing Microsoft Access database with a SQL database and a Python-based user interface. The goal was to make the data easier to manage, update, and maintain over time. One of the main challenges of this project was learning to work with geology-specific terminology and data structures that I had never encountered before, which required frequent communication and clarification with the department like a real client relationship.

This project gave me hands-on experience with database design, data migration, and building software for users who are not programmers. It was especially valuable because it required thinking beyond just getting the code to run, and instead focusing on usability, permission levels, and long-term reliability in a real academic setting.

## 📍 St. Paul Crime Map Single-Page Application
🔗 **Repository:** [*https://github.com/ranglall/webdev-crimespa*](https://github.com/ranglall/webdev-crimespa)

This project is a single-page web application that allows users to explore crime data across St. Paul neighborhoods using an interactive map. It was built with Vue.js and integrates several APIs, including Leaflet for mapping, Nominatim for location search, and a custom REST API for crime data.

I selected this project because it shows my ability to build a full web application that connects frontend and backend components. It also demonstrates how data can be presented in a way that is more accessible and useful for users, rather than just displaying raw tables or numbers.

## Closing Reflection
These projects represent different parts of my academic experience at the University of St. Thomas, including coursework in artificial intelligence, databases, data science, and web development. Together, they show my ability to analyze real datasets, design and implement software systems, and connect technical concepts to practical, real-world problems.
